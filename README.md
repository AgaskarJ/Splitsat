SplitSAT is a search engine that utilizes a MySQL database for users to search for frequent words that appear on the vocabulary section of the SATs. I also implemented a user system for students to add words and comment. I worked this website from January 2015 to February 2017. It was hosted on my domain splitsat.com and took it down following the redesign to the new SATs in 2016. 

This project was made with PHP, HTML, Materialize CSS, JavaScript (jquery) and MySQL. It implements Cloudflare and Base-64 encryption for passwords.
